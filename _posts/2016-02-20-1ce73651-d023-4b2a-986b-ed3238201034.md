Miriam Baker is a line of classically styled and beautifully tailored women's wear designed to accommodate a fuller bust. Many women, including the designer herself, struggle to find clothes that fit and flatter the figure. Miriam felt inspired to find a solution and created a line of ready-to-wear for women who are C-Cup and above.

In October 2013 Miriam Baker entered TFI's Most Promising New Label Competition as one of ten semi-finalists from across the country. She created a twelve look collection praised for its feminine cuts, succinct colour story, and specialty size range.

Miriam was chosen as one of four designers to present at the New Labels fashion show in May 2014 where her collection was awarded the grand prize courtesy of Susanne Rogers.
